# Spotify-Recommender
Spotify heavily relies on collaborative filtering to make recommendations, which is the practice of cross-referencing their usersâ€™ listening patterns and making recommendations based on overlap between persons or groups. What this app aims to do is to take the counterpart, content filtering, which is the process of making recommendations based solely on the features of the music itself, and see how well a recommender system can do on that alone.
